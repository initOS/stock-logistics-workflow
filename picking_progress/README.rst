Picking Progress
================

This module adds a display of the progress of pickings.

The progress of a picking is the percentage of its non-cancelled lines (i.e.,
stock moves) that are 'done'.  It will be displayed as a progress bar in both
the picking tree view and form view.


Usage
=====

Installing this module modifies the *stock.picking* tree view by adding a
'Progress' column

of the name field
